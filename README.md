# Game From Scratch
Just trying to create a 2D game with no external libraries to learn some stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
why not 3D cause I don't want to deal with 3d rotations and I don't want this to be a huge project ┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
# Systems in play
## Entity Component System Implementation 
- Created Entity Component System from scratch as Static Lib so I can use it in my other projects if needed
- Need to use the Registry object to create entities, register systems and components also add components to entities
- I am not going to write full-on documentation here I just created it and don't really expect anyone else but me to use it
## Event system 
- Just a simple Evetn system with a dispatcher which has a list of function pointers easy stuff
## Renderer
- Well I am building a very minimal renderer and trying to abstract openGL to my classes we will see how it goes
## Physics
- Still working process I hope to get to it
- (._.) ( l: ) ( .-. ) ( :l ) (._.)
## Using code template provided by UbisoftNext 
Using only splog for logging, and freeglut and glew to draw stuff
