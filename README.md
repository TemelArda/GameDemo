# Space Invaders Kind of Game From Scratch

# Systems in play :))
## ECS 
- Created Entity Component System from scratch as Static Lib so I can use it in my other projects if needed
- Need to use the Registry object to create entities, register systems and components also add components to entities
- I am not going to write full-on documentation here I just created it and don't really expect anyone else but me to use it


## Using code template provided by UbisoftNext 
Using only spdlog for loggin and glut to draw stuff
